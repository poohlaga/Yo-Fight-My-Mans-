# Yo-Fight-My-Mans

This is code I used for an installation featured in 'Yo, Fight My Mans', a collabarative exhibit between [Chillin Island](http://www.chillinisland.com/), Jacob Reinstein and [Babycastles](http://www.babycastles.com).

The installation featured two mannequins representing Dap's mother and father. Visitors would approach his 'parents', be promped to press a button and upon pressing, hear his 'parents' relay personal stories through a set of speakers mounted in the mannequins.

Dap (the artist) recorded audio of his parents talking and we converted it to MP3 files. I used the Arduino ["Music Maker" MP3 Shield](https://www.adafruit.com/product/1788) to store the MP3's and play the audio back on button press.

There are two versions of the code with different actions:
* two buttons (one for mom, one for dad). they each say one story.
* one button, each says 3 things and they take turns and it cycles (e.g.: m1, d1, m2, d2, m3, d3, m1...)
